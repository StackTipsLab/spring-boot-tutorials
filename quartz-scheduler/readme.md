# Working with Quartz Scheduler in Spring Boot

Quartz Scheduler is an open-source job scheduling library that allows developers to schedule jobs to run at a certain time or based on specific events. This library eliminates the limitations in the Spring scheduler.

### Quartz allows developers to:

- Schedule jobs to run at a specific time, or repeat at intervals - Store jobs and their triggers in a database, allowing scheduled jobs to persist between application restarts.
- Run in a clustered environment, allowing jobs to be distributed across a cluster of servers for load balancing or redundancy.
- Allows transaction management to ensure the jobs are only executed after transactions are successfully committed.

In this article, we will cover different aspects of the Quartz Scheduler and how it integrates with the Spring Boot application.
