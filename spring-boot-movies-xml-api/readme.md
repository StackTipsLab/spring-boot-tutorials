# Handling XML Request and Response in Spring Boot REST

This article explains how to handle XML Request and Response in Spring Boot REST APIs using `jackson-dataformat-xml` library.

In the course of this post, we will create a `MoviesController` and expose set of RESTful API endpoints to perform database CRUD operations.

- A POST endpoint that ads a new movie into the database
- By default, the controller class will accept the JSON request and produces the JSON response.
